# OrchID - Orchestrator for Intelligent Defence


OrchID is an OpenC2 proxy built in Django 1.10.2. OrchID aims to provide a simple, modular API to begin accepting OpenC2 commands and converting them to Python actions.

## Setup

In it's current state it is a fairly light weight Django app with few dependencies,

	pip install requests
   	pip install django==1.10.2
	pip install jsonschema

OrchID will require database config, although it its current state the database is not used, later revisions will use it for storing user credentials when I add authentication, so its best you set one up now. The project comes shipped with the settings necessary for setting up MySQL, but any Django database engine should work fine, you will just need to create a database called "orchid" and a user to connect to it.


    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'orchid',
            'USER': '',
            'PASSWORD': '',
            'HOST': 'localhost',   # Or an IP Address that your DB is hosted on
            'PORT': '3306',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"
            }
        }
    }

For future reference you may also need to run the following when I get started adding the database functions:

	python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate


## Get Started

OrchID runs with the standard runserver command:

	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

This project is a fully fledged deployment, but the "orchid" folder should stand alone as an importable django app if you want to use it in your project.

## Custom Config

OrchID uses the Django settings fill to get information about the actuators it can connect to, currently there are these two:

    # OPENC2 Controlled BIND DNS Servers
    OPENC2_BIND_DNS_SERVERS = [
        {
                        'hostname':'dns_server_1',
                        'ip':'10.10.10.1',
                        'username':'bind_user',
                        'password':'bind_password',
        },
        {
                        'hostname':'dns_server_2',
                        'ip':'10.10.10.2',
                        'username':'bind_user',
                        'password':'bind_password',
        }
    ]

    # OPENC2 Controlled Juniper Firewalls
    OPENC2_JUNIPER_FIREWALLS = [
        {
                        'hostname':'r1_juniper',
                        'ip':'10.10.10.1',
                        'version':'SSG5',
                        'public_interfaces':[
                                {"fe-0/0/0":"0.0.0.0/0"},
                            ],
                        'internal_interfaces':[
                                {"fe-0/1/0":"192.168.1.0/24"}
                        ],
                        'username':'juniper_user',
                        'password':'juniper_password',
        },
        {
                        'hostname':'r2_juniper',
                        'ip':'10.10.10.2',
                        'version':'SRX',
                        'public_interfaces':[
                                {"fe-0/0/0":"0.0.0.0/0"},
                            ],
                        'internal_interfaces':[
                                {"fe-0/1/0":"192.168.1.0/24"}
                        ],
                        'username':'juniper_user',
                        'password':'juniper_password',
        }
    ]

These are just to showcase how I envision it working, as no actuator logic is in this project to perform actions on vendor appliances (profiles just print to the console log currently) you can leave these in until you are confident enough to start writing your own profiles.
    
## Testing

I have added two unit tests, they check all JSON samples in the ./sample folder are valid JSONs then pass them through the command dispatcher. The test fails if the dispatcher doesn't return a 200 status code. Tests can be run with:

	python manage.py test orchid


## Thanks

Large portions of this project are based on the Yuuki project by Joshua Brul√©, without Yuuki this project would not exists as Josh solved some of the fundamental design problems in making OpenC2 proxies a reality. Thanks for kicking down the door for us all Josh.

Also a big thanks to everyone in the OpenC2 community, on phone calls and on Slack you have always been helpful when I have struggled with understanding components of OpenC2 and I look forward to shaping the future of defence with you all.
